-# Principles
-- ...
+# Principles
+- UX & visual excellence: design for clarity and delight; use purposeful typography, balanced spacing, and disciplined color/contrast that meets WCAG AA; prefer intentional motion that supports comprehension.
+- Consistency first: use shared tokens, grids, and component patterns; keep states aligned (hover/focus/active/disabled) and cross-device behavior predictable.
+- Semantic structure: HTML defines meaning and hierarchy with proper landmarks, form labels, and ARIA only when semantics are insufficient; avoid presentational markup.
+- Separation of concerns: CSS owns layout and styling (no inline styles except critical overrides); JS owns behavior and state; avoid mixing structure/styling/behavior in the same layer.
+- Standards & accessibility: follow W3C specs for markup, forms, media, and navigation; default to progressive enhancement; ensure keyboard operability and clear focus management.
+- Performance discipline: set budgets for LCP/TTI/CLS; ship minimal, tree-shaken JS; defer non-critical work; optimize and lazy-load media; leverage caching and HTTP/2/3 best practices.
+- Code quality: favor readable, composable components; DRY without over-abstraction; validate with linters/tests; document edge cases and rationale for non-obvious decisions.
+- Testing & monitoring: cover critical user paths and accessibility checks in CI; guard against regressions in rendering, responsiveness, and interactions; monitor real-user metrics and fix regressions quickly.

-  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
--->
-
-- What happens when [boundary condition]?
-- How does system handle [error scenario]?
+### Edge Cases
+
+- Guidance appears outdated or conflicting: page surfaces last-updated/version info and points to an owner for resolution.
+- Collaborator is unsure which section applies: quick-start cues (e.g., by role or phase) direct them to the right entry.
+- Broken or external links: fallbacks or alternate references are provided so users are not blocked.
+- Mobile or small-screen access: navigation and checklists remain legible and reachable without horizontal scrolling.
 
 ## Requirements *(mandatory)*
 
 <!--
   ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
   Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
 -->
 
 ### Functional Requirements

-*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
-
-- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
-- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]
+- **FR-001**: The landing content MUST state the purpose, audience (Product & Tech collaborators), and how to use the Ways of Work index.
+- **FR-002**: Navigation MUST group primary sections by role and/or delivery phase so users can reach any top-level guideline in two or fewer interactions.
+- **FR-003**: Each guideline entry MUST present what it is, when to use it, the required steps, expected outputs, and the accountable/consulted roles.
+- **FR-004**: Each process section MUST include error-prevention aids (e.g., readiness checklist or do/don’t list) aligned to the steps.
+- **FR-005**: Ownership MUST be visible for each area (named role/team) along with a way to contact or escalate questions.
+- **FR-006**: The index MUST show last-updated/version info for each section so users can detect stale guidance.
+- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to find content by keyword or by filtering on role/process so they can locate relevant guidance quickly.
+- **FR-008**: The page MUST provide a clear path to propose improvements or report conflicts (e.g., feedback link or form) with confirmation that the submission is captured.
+- **FR-009**: Key resources (templates, checklists, references) linked from each section MUST be reachable from the index without dead ends.
+- **FR-010**: Content layout MUST remain readable and navigable on common screen sizes used by collaborators (desktop and mobile) without losing required information.
@@
 ### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
 
-- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
-- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
+- **Way of Work item**: A guidance entry with title, audience, when-to-use, steps, outputs, owner, last-updated/version, and linked resources.
+- **Role/Audience**: Product & Tech collaborator roles (e.g., PM, engineer, design, QA) with mappings to the guidelines they own or consume.
+- **Feedback/Proposal**: A submission capturing the topic, reporter, date, and requested change routed to the listed owner.
@@
 ### Measurable Outcomes
 
-- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
-- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
-- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
-- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
+- **SC-001**: In usability sessions, 90% of Product & Tech collaborators can reach their relevant guideline within 2 clicks/taps and under 20 seconds.
+- **SC-002**: 80% of collaborators can correctly list the required steps, outputs, and accountable role for a chosen process after reviewing its section, without facilitator help.
+- **SC-003**: Error/friction reports related to unclear or missing Ways of Work decrease by 30% within one month of launch.
+- **SC-004**: At least 70% of collaborators who attempt to give feedback can find and submit it via the provided path in under 2 minutes, and receive confirmation.

+### User Story 1 - Understand each track (Priority: P1)
+
+A Product or Tech collaborator opens the Continuous Flow Engine overview and can quickly grasp what each of the 3 tracks is for, the value it delivers, and the activities within it.
+
+**Why this priority**: Clear understanding of each track is foundational to using the engine correctly.
+
+**Independent Test**: A new collaborator can name each track, its purpose/value, and its core activities after reading the overview.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** a collaborator on the overview page, **When** they scan the 3 track summaries, **Then** they can state the value and outcomes of each track.
+2. **Given** a collaborator reviewing a specific track section, **When** they read its activity list, **Then** they can describe what happens in that track without external explanation.

+### User Story 2 - See synergy and feedback loops (Priority: P2)
+
+The collaborator understands how the 3 tracks run in parallel, how they reinforce each other, and where feedback loops occur.
+
+**Why this priority**: Correct simultaneous execution depends on seeing the interactions and loops, not just isolated tracks.
+
+**Independent Test**: A collaborator can draw or explain how outputs from one track feed another and where loops close.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** a collaborator viewing the combined view, **When** they follow the depicted flows, **Then** they can point to at least one feedback loop between tracks.
+2. **Given** a collaborator preparing to coordinate work, **When** they review the synergy guidance, **Then** they can identify what to run in parallel and why it improves outcomes.

+### Edge Cases
+
+- Reader is unfamiliar with the Continuous Flow Engine: overview gives a concise definition before diving into tracks.
+- Tracks appear siloed: page provides combined view and examples to reinforce parallel execution.
+- Feedback loops are unclear: visual and text reinforce what triggers loops and expected outcomes.
+- Key actions or success signals vary by context: note any context-specific adjustments or constraints.
+- Mobile/small screen: combined view remains legible and the three tracks can still be compared.
+
+**Assumptions/Dependencies**: Content for each track, activities, feedback loops, and success signals is available from the process owners; readers have general Product/Tech context; terminology is consistent across tracks.

+### Edge Cases
+
+- Data gaps for stressors or dependencies: visuals indicate missing data and direct to owners.
+- Overlapping stressors lead to clutter: map consolidates or layers stressors to remain legible.
+- Mobile/small screen: executive summary and key interactions stay readable without losing critical cues.
+- Stale data: last-updated indicators alert readers to potential obsolescence.
+- Ambiguous terminology: glossary/legend clarifies stressors, adapters, residues, criticality, hyper-minimal dependency.
+
+**Assumptions/Dependencies**: Stressor definitions, component topology, adapters, residues, and criticality scoring are available from architecture/ops owners; terminology is agreed; data can be refreshed periodically.

+# Implementation Plan: Context Map with Layer Ownership for Frictionless DevEx
+
+**Branch**: `[001-context-map-ownership]` | **Date**: 2025-12-05 | **Spec**: specs/001-context-map-ownership/spec.md
+**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-context-map-ownership/spec.md`
+
+**Note**: Prepared with current repo stack (static HTML/CSS/JS).
 
 ## Summary
 
-[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]
+Improve the context map and layer ownership content so engineers and PMs can see layer purposes, owners, dependencies, and friction indicators quickly, supporting a frictionless developer experience. Deliver as a static HTML/CSS/JS page using the existing stack with clearer ownership labeling, dependency cues, friction reporting path, and an executive summary.
 
 ## Technical Context
@@
-**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
-**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
-**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
-**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
-**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
-**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
-**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
-**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
-**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
+**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
+**Primary Dependencies**: None (no frameworks; current stack only)  
+**Storage**: N/A (static content)  
+**Testing**: Manual browser verification; lightweight accessibility and link checks  
+**Target Platform**: Modern evergreen browsers (desktop and mobile)  
+**Project Type**: Single-page web (static)  
+**Performance Goals**: First view loads under 1s on broadband; avoid blocking scripts; keep assets lean  
+**Constraints**: Keep delivered assets <150KB gzip; responsive and accessible; no new build toolchain  
+**Scale/Scope**: Single page with context map, ownership labeling, dependency/fraction cues, feedback path

+# Research Summary
+
+## Decision: Keep current stack (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS), no new build tools
+- **Rationale**: User requested “use the current stack”; existing repo is static. Keeps footprint minimal and aligns with performance/DevEx goals.
+- **Alternatives considered**: Add a JS framework (adds complexity, unnecessary for static content); add build tooling (overhead without dynamic needs).
+
+## Decision: Structure map as layered sections with ownership and dependency callouts
+- **Rationale**: Clear sections per layer with owner/contact, scope, and dependency badges makes ownership discoverable in <30s and supports friction reduction.
+- **Alternatives considered**: Single long list (harder to scan); modal-heavy UI (hurts mobile/responsiveness).
+
+## Decision: Friction reporting via provided intake link/mailto plus inline confirmation
+- **Rationale**: Static stack lacks backend; linking to an existing intake path (mail, form, ticket queue) satisfies “report/suggest” while keeping current stack. Inline “sent/opened” confirmation clarifies action.
+- **Alternatives considered**: Build custom form + backend (not in scope/current stack); no reporting path (fails requirements).
+
+## Decision: Performance/accessibility guardrails
+- **Rationale**: Lean CSS/JS, no blocking assets, maintain semantic HTML and ARIA for clarity and fast load under ~1s.
+- **Alternatives considered**: Heavy visualizations or external libs (risk bloat and slower loads).

+# Quickstart: Context Map with Layer Ownership
+
+## Prereqs
+- Modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge)
+- Optional: local HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server 8000`) for CORS-safe testing
+
+## Run locally (current stack)
+1) From repo root: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
+2) Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
+3) Verify ownership labels, dependency cues, friction indicators, and executive summary render on desktop and mobile sizes.
+
+## Edit
+- Content/UI: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`
+- Spec/plan artifacts: `specs/001-context-map-ownership/`
+- Keep assets lean (<150KB gzip) and avoid new build tools.
+
+## Validate
+- Manual: check navigation/anchors, ownership visibility (<30s find time), dependency/fun friction cues, feedback link produces confirmation.
+- Accessibility: headings order, labels, focus states, color contrast.
+- Performance: load page; ensure no blocking external assets; basic Lighthouse or DevTools audit for quick check.

+# Tasks: Context Map with Layer Ownership for Frictionless DevEx
+
+**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-context-map-ownership/`  
+**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
+
+**Tests**: Not requested; focus on implementation and manual validation per quickstart.
+
+**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.
+
+## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)
+
+**Purpose**: Prepare page structure and styling foundations using the current static stack.
+
+- [ ] T001 [P] Create structural sections for summary, layers, dependencies, and friction containers in `index.html`
+- [ ] T002 [P] Add CSS variables, grid/layout, and badge styles to support ownership/dependency/friction views in `style.css`
+- [ ] T003 Add base script hooks (query selectors and empty render slots) for the new sections in `script.js`
+
+---
+
+## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)
+
+**Purpose**: Shared data scaffolding and legend needed before story-specific rendering.
+
+- [ ] T004 Seed placeholder data structures for layers, components, owners, dependencies, friction indicators, and executive summary in `script.js`
+- [ ] T005 Add shared render utilities for badges, lists, last-updated text, and responsive truncation in `script.js`
+- [ ] T006 Add legend/glossary section markup (stressors/ownership/dependency/friction keys) with anchors in `index.html`
+
+**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel.
+
+---
+
+## Phase 3: User Story 1 - See ownership at a glance (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP
+
+**Goal**: Show each layer’s purpose and clear owner/contact so users can find ownership within 30s.
+
+**Independent Test**: From the landing view, identify the owner for any layer/component in under 30 seconds.
+
+### Implementation for User Story 1
+
+- [ ] T007 [US1] Populate layer/component ownership data (owners, contacts, engagement rules) aligned to entities in `script.js`
+- [ ] T008 [US1] Render ownership cards with layer purpose, scope, owner badges, and contact/engagement cues in `script.js` (using `index.html` containers)
+- [ ] T009 [P] [US1] Style ownership badges, focus states, and mobile readability for ownership sections in `style.css`
+
+**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 independently deliverable (ownership clarity and contact paths visible).
+
+---
+
+## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Navigate dependencies with minimal friction (Priority: P2)
+
+**Goal**: Let users trace upstream/downstream dependencies with engagement expectations visible.
+
+**Independent Test**: Trace a dependency and find the owning team plus engagement/SLA info without external help.
+
+### Implementation for User Story 2
+
+- [ ] T010 [US2] Extend data with dependencies and engagement expectations between components/layers in `script.js`
+- [ ] T011 [US2] Render dependency view with upstream/downstream cues, owner attribution, and SLA hints in `script.js` (using `index.html` containers)
+- [ ] T012 [P] [US2] Add cross-layer navigation anchors/jump links and inline labels to support dependency tracing in `index.html` and `style.css`
+
+**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 independently deliverable (dependency tracing and engagement clarity).
+
+---
+
+## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Spot and fix friction points (Priority: P3)
+
+**Goal**: Expose friction indicators and provide a clear reporting/action path with confirmation.
+
+**Independent Test**: Click a friction indicator, see owner/action path, and submit/report with visible confirmation cue.
+
+### Implementation for User Story 3
+
+- [ ] T013 [US3] Add friction indicator data (severity/status/owner) and link to affected layers/components in `script.js`
+- [ ] T014 [US3] Render friction indicators with owner, resolution path (mailto/intake link), and confirmation messaging in `script.js` (using `index.html` containers)
+- [ ] T015 [P] [US3] Update executive summary to surface top friction hotspots and timestamps in `index.html` and `script.js`
+
+**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 independently deliverable (friction visibility and reporting path).
+
+---
+
+## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
+
+**Purpose**: Final refinements across stories.
+
+- [ ] T016 [P] Refine copy and headings for ownership, dependency, and friction sections for executive readability in `index.html`
+- [ ] T017 Improve responsive spacing, contrast, and touch targets for all new elements in `style.css`
+- [ ] T018 Record manual validation notes (ownership findability, dependency trace, friction reporting flow) in `specs/001-context-map-ownership/quickstart.md`
+
+---
+
+## Dependencies & Execution Order
+
+- Phase 1 → Phase 2 → User stories (US1 → US2 → US3 by priority; US2/US3 can run in parallel after Phase 2 if staffed).
+- Polish after desired user stories are complete.
+
+## Parallel Opportunities (examples)
+
+- Phase 1: T001 (HTML scaffolding) and T002 (CSS tokens) in parallel.
+- Phase 3 (US1): T009 styling in parallel with T007/T008 data+render.
+- Phase 4 (US2): T012 navigation aids in parallel with T010/T011.
+- Phase 5 (US3): T015 summary in parallel with T013/T014.
+
+## Implementation Strategy
+
+- MVP: Complete Phases 1–2, then deliver US1; validate ownership clarity before adding dependencies/friction.
+- Incremental: Add US2 (dependency tracing), then US3 (friction/reporting), keeping each story independently testable per its checkpoint.

 ## Validate
-- Manual: check navigation/anchors, ownership visibility (<30s find time), dependency/fun friction cues, feedback link produces confirmation.
-- Accessibility: headings order, labels, focus states, color contrast.
-- Performance: load page; ensure no blocking external assets; basic Lighthouse or DevTools audit for quick check.
+- Manual:
+  - Ownership: pick any layer/component and find owner/contact in <30s.
+  - Dependencies: trace a listed dependency and confirm owner + expectation/SLA is visible.
+  - Friction: open a friction item, see action path, and trigger the mailto/intake link with confirmation cue.
+  - Navigation: legend/jump links work; context map anchors reachable.
+- Accessibility: headings order, labels, focus states, color contrast.
+- Performance: load page; ensure no blocking external assets; basic Lighthouse or DevTools audit for quick check.
